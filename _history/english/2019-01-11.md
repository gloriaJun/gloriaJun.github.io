Where Is Here?

‘Jack looked out the window.
Jack은 창문 밖을 쳐다보았다.

*He looked down at the picture in the book.*
*그는 아래를 쳐다보았다 사진의 책에 있는*

He looked back out the window.
그는 창 밖의 뒤를 쳐다보았다.

The world outside and the world in the picture—they were exactly the same.
그 세계의 주변과 사진의 세계는 - 그들이 정확히 같은 곳에 존재했다.

The Pteranodon was soaring through the sky. The ground was covered with ferns and tall grass. There was a winding stream. A sloping hill. And volcanoes in the distance.
Pteranodon는 하늘을 날아오르고 있었다. 땅은 양치식물과 긴 잔디들로 덮여있었다. 그곳에는 구불구불한 개울이 있었다. 경사진 언덕. 그리고 멀리 화산이 있었다.

“Wh-where are we?” stammered Jack.
"후~우린 어디에 잇는거지?" Jack이 말을 더듬었다.

The Pteranodon glided down to the base of their tree. The creature coasted to a stop. *And stood very still.*
Pteranodon 트리하우스의 아래로 미끄러지듯이 내려갔다. 그 생명체는 해변에서 멈췄다. *And stood very still.*

“What happened to us?” said Annie. She looked at Jack. He looked at her.
"우리에게 무슨 일이 일어난거지?" Annie가 말햇어요. 그녀는 Jack을 쳐다보았어요. 그는 그녀를 쳐다보았어요.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I was looking at the picture in the book—’
"나도 모르겠어" Jack이 말했어요. "나는 책에 있는 사진을 보았어."

‘And you said, ‘Wow, I wish I could see a Pteranodon for real,’ ” said Annie.
그리고 너가 말했어. "와우, 나는 진짜로 Pteranodon를 볼수 있기를 바래" Annie가 말했어요.

*“Yeah. And then we saw one. In the Frog Creek woods,” said Jack요*
*"응, 그리고 우리는 하나를 보았어. Frog Creek의 나무를" Jack이 말했어요*

“Yeah. And then the wind got loud. And the tree house started spinning,” said Annie.
"응. 그리고 바람이 소리를 내었어. 그리고 트리하우스가 돌기 시작했어" Annie가 말했어요.

“And we landed here,” said Jack.
"그리고 우리는 여기에 도착했어" Jack이 말했어요.

“And we landed here,” said Annie.
“So that means … ” said Jack.
“So that means … what?” said Annie.
“Nothing,” said Jack. He shook his head. “None of this can be real.”
Annie looked out the window again. “But he’s real,” she said. “He’s very real.”
Jack looked out the window with her. The Pteranodon was standing at the base of the oak tree. Like a guard. His giant wings were spread out on either side of him.
“Hi!” Annie shouted.
“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be here.’

‘But where is here?” said Annie.
“I don’t know,” said Jack.
“Hi!” Annie called again to the creature.
The Pteranodon looked up at them.
“Where is here?” Annie called down.
“You’re nuts. He can’t talk,” said Jack. “But maybe the book can tell us.”
Jack looked down at the book. He read the words under the picture:
This flying reptile lived in the Cretaceous period. It vanished 65 million years ago.
No. Impossible. They couldn’t have landed in a time 65 million years ago.
“Jack,” said Annie. “He’s nice.”
“Nice?”
“Yeah, I can tell. Let’s go down and talk to him.”
“Talk to him?”
Annie started down the rope ladder.
“Hey!” shouted Jack.
But Annie kept going.
‘Are you crazy?” Jack called.
Annie dropped to the ground. She stepped boldly up to the ancient creature.’
